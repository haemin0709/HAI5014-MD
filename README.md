## 0. What is a Chatbot?
_IBM, 2024_
> A chatbot is a computer program that simulates conversation with users through text (or voice). Early chatbots followed simple rules and could only respond to predefined questions.
However, Modern chatbots use AI technologies like natural language processing (NLP) and machine learning to understand user intent and generate natural responses.

➡️  _**Before discussing what makes a chatbot good or bad, it is important to understand the different types of chatbots—because the criteria for evaluation often depend on the chatbot’s primary purpose.**_
