|----------------|--------------------------------|--------------------------------|
| **Installation Required** | ❌ (Runs directly in the browser)  | ✅ (Needs to be installed locally) |
| **Environment Setup**  | Automated (`.devcontainer.json`)  | Manual setup required          |
| **Performance Dependence** | Uses cloud resources (High performance) | Depends on local machine specs |
| **Internet Connection**  | Required (Cloud-based)           | Not required (Works offline)   |
| **Collaboration**  | ✅ (Consistent environment for teams) | ❌ (Environment differences possible) |
| **Security & Backup**  | Cloud storage (Safe & reliable)   | Local storage (Risk of data loss) |
| **Cost**  | Paid (Usage-based pricing)  | Free (Uses local resources)  |
